Download the files of this github repository in the same folder python and the libraries were downloaded.

From your terminal (command prompt), navigate to the folder where python, our github code and the libraries are downloaded and type jupyter notebook. This will open our code in jupyter notebook. A webpage should open automatically.

From there, clicking on MP1.ipynb file will bring you to our code. Each question are delimited by boxes that can be run separatly. Make sure they are run in order, as some depend on previous ones.
